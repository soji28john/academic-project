    "The objective is to automate quality control in injection moulding by predicting the mould opening distance from process signals. A regression model is trained on synthetic time-series data, and a statistical ±2σ acceptance rule is applied to classify products as valid or faulty. The trained model is then evaluated on real production data without retraining to assess generalization capability.\n",
