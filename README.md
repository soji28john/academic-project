In this repository contains various academic projects in the field of Artificial intelligence.
### In the cloud computing and bigdata project project implements a distributed Stock Exchange system using modern cloud computing technologies (Branch- Master)
including Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and microservices architecture. 
### Information Visualisation project 2024-25(group project-shared)
This project helps people explore job opportunities in a better way. We made an Job Statistics Visualisation Tool interactive tool
that shows job data from LinkedIn. The dataset taken from kaggle(linkedin job postings from 2023-2024) includes over 124,000 job posts from 2023 and 2024. Our targetted users are students, 
job seekers, teachers, and data analysts learn what kinds of jobs and skills are growing in demand. Users can click,
zoom, and explore the job trends in real time.
### Machine learning project related to the image classification of animals by using different ML algorithms.
### Statistical foundation of ML project is related to the research question of Machine laearning and we analyze the data with visuals by using ml algorithms.
### Reinforcement learning project implement the simple agent by using neural network algorithms.
### Master's thesis - Transfer learning for automated Quality control in Injection moulding.
