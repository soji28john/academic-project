Technologies: 
•	JavaScript/Node.js for uniform backend services (async I/O handling)
•	Docker and Kubernetes: Containerization and orchestration for scalability.
•	React.js and Chart.js: Real-time dashboard for order book visualization.
•	WebSocket: Real-time data broadcasting from Market Data Publisher to Dashboard.
Outcome: The deployed project successfully demonstrated how a cloud-based stock exchange application can be developed with simple JavaScript services,
containerized into Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and visualized in the front-end with real-time updates using ReactJS. The microservices architecture provides scalability and maintainability, while Kubernetes offers robust deployment and management capabilities.
