Transfer Learning for Automated Quality Control in Injection Moulding (Time series project with real-world datasets).
ML algorithms can learn complex relationships between process parameters and product quality, and can predict critical quality indicators 
enabling real-time defect detection, process optimization, and predictive maintenance. 
The solution uses 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model on simulated data and a limited real-world dataset, and applies transfer learning to finetune the developed ML model. 
The 1D-CNN model analyses high-frequency time-series sensor data (Pressure and Volume), capturing temporal sensor patterns ignored by traditional machine learning methods. Key Solution Concepts: 1D- CNN, Transfer Learning, Time series regression, Signal resampling, Statistical Quality control.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Outcome: Optimized model performance through fine-tuning, mitigate the simulated to real data gap, reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 48.8mm to 0.44mm, ensuring high-precision monitoring of the mould-opening process.
