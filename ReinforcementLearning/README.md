Reinforcement learning project implement the simple agent by using neural network algorithms.
The Fundamental project focuses on the Agent side of a Reinforcement 
Learning setting. In this project, we have to implement a Reinforcement Learning agent.
For building this project we use Gradient free optimization algorithm 
and we are implemented in two methods zeroth order and population methods.
