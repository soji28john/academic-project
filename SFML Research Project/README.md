In this project, based on the research question we have to implement different ml models in the aspects of statistics with visualization.
And prepare a report based on the findings.
In this project we implemented both both classification and regression and I used 2 different ML-algorithms.
We use a library like scikitlearn and explian the ML-algorithm and the used important (hyper)parameters.
