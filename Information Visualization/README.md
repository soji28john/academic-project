Information Visualisation project 2024-25
This project helps people explore job opportunities in a better way. We made an Job Statistics Visualisation Tool interactive tool
that shows job data from LinkedIn. The dataset taken from kaggle(linkedin job postings from 2023-2024) includes over 124,000 job posts from 2023 and 2024. Our targetted users are students, 
job seekers, teachers, and data analysts learn what kinds of jobs and skills are growing in demand. Users can click,
zoom, and explore the job trends in real time.
